# SmartTrans

> SmartTrans is a truck asset and freight management system that help to keep track of all the vehicles, and also to create a work order that will help the truck driver to go and pick up the load and deliver it to the delivery location. Once the load is delivered, the controller user can send the work order to the Account department. That Accountant user can generate an invoice for the client and save data to the Pastel Account PostgreSQL database.
